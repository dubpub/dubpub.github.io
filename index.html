          <p>Lebowski ipsum you know, little of this, little of that. Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit praesent ac magna justo. Dude, please!… Is this your homework, Larry? Pellentesque ac lectus quis elit blandit fringilla a ut turpis praesent felis ligula, malesuada. What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?! Suscipit malesuada non, ultrices non urna sed orci ipsum, placerat id condimentum rutrum.</p>

<p>Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man. And thorough. Rhoncus ac lorem aliquam placerat posuere neque. Wal, I lost m'chain of thought here. But—aw hell, I done innerduced him enough. At dignissim magna ullamcorper in aliquam sagittis massa ac tortor. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins. Lotta outs. And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Ultrices faucibus curabitur eu mi sapien, ut ultricies ipsum morbi eget risus nulla.</p>

<p>Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor. Nullam vel nisi enim, vel auctor ante morbi id. Uh, yeah. Probably a vagrant, slept in the car. Or perhaps just used it as a toilet, and moved on. Urna vel felis lacinia placerat vestibulum. No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the impression that we're police exactly. We're hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police. Turpis nulla, viverra nec.</p>

<p>Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame. Volutpat ac, ornare id lectus cras pharetra. Vee could do things you only dreamed of, Lebowski. Faucibus tristique nullam non accumsan justo nulla facilisi integer interdum elementum nulla, nec. I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners. Shit. I sure hope he makes The finals. Welp, that about does her, wraps her all up. Things seem to've worked out pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, and it was a purt good story, dontcha think? Made me laugh to beat the band. Parts, anyway. Course—I didn't like seein' Donny go. But then, happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way. I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself, down through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time until— aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' again. Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed yourselves. Eleifend nisl euismod ac maecenas vitae eros velit, eu suscipit erat integer.</p>

<p>Fucking fascist! Purus lacus, pretium vel venenatis eu, volutpat non. Goddamnit Walter! You fucking asshole! Erat donec a metus ac eros dictum aliquet nulla consectetur egestas placerat maecenas. Any further harm visited upon Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head. Pulvinar nisl et nisl rhoncus at volutpat felis blandit in libero turpis, laoreet. JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! Et molestie sed, volutpat.</p>
